            <p>An <strong>operating system </strong>, also known as an OS, is a system software that manages computer hardware, software, and provides services for various
            computer programs. An OS acts as an <strong>intermediary</strong> between programs and computer hardware to facilitate usage.
            Operating Systems are not only found in computers but are also present in cell phones, video game consoles, and web servers.</p><br>
